Let's pop some quiz


See pic1.png in repo for numbers reference.

We have a beutiful app.
1. Some dev implemented a feature
2. Code review raised no questions and faeture branch was merged into version branch
3. Somehow things went south in version branch. We had to revert the merge.
4. Dev made fixes and asks for another merge

The question is: 
- What should we do to avoid merge conflicts while merging feature branch with a fix?
Bonus question:
- Can you explain, why merge conflict appeared at all?
